# Predicting-vulnerabilities-in-JavaScript-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
Hi code lovers. This is my Final year group project. In this project we created a Model in which it helps web-developers to find and predict vulnerabilities in JavaScript code by combining three different types of machine learning algoritms like KNN, SVM and Naive Bayes.
